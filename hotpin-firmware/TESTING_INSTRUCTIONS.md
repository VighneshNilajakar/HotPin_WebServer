# HotPin Firmware WiFi Configuration and Testing Instructions

## Problem Summary
The HotPin firmware was failing to connect to the WebSocket server with the following issues:
1. WiFi was not properly initialized (ESP_ERR_WIFI_NOT_STARTED error)
2. WiFi credentials were set to placeholder values ("wifi" SSID)
3. Incorrect WiFi initialization sequence

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed WiFi Initialization Sequence
Updated `main/network_handling.c` to correct the WiFi initialization order:
- Moved `esp_wifi_start()` before `esp_wifi_connect()`
- Added proper error checking for each step
- Improved configuration validation

### 2. Updated Default Configuration
Modified `main/Kconfig.projbuild` to use empty defaults:
- Changed default SSID from "wifi" to "" (empty)
- Changed default password from "123456780" to "" (empty)
- Added help text explaining that empty values disable WiFi

### 3. Added Configuration Documentation
- Created `sdkconfig.local.example` with proper configuration template
- Updated README.md with WiFi configuration instructions

## Testing Instructions

### Step 1: Configure WiFi Credentials
1. Run `idf.py menuconfig`
2. Navigate to "HotPin Configuration"
3. Set your WiFi SSID and password
4. Save configuration

Alternatively:
1. Copy `sdkconfig.local.example` to `sdkconfig.local`
2. Edit `sdkconfig.local` with your WiFi credentials:
   ```
   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_SSID="YourActualWiFiSSID"
   CONFIG_ESP_WIFI_PASSWORD="YourActualWiFiPassword"
   ```

### Step 2: Build and Flash
```bash
idf.py build
idf.py flash
```

### Step 3: Monitor Serial Output
```bash
idf.py monitor
```

### Expected Results
1. WiFi should initialize and connect successfully
2. WebSocket client should connect to `ws://10.50.92.58:8000/ws`
3. No more "Host is unreachable" errors in the logs
4. Device should appear as connected in the webserver

## Troubleshooting

### If WiFi Still Fails to Connect:
1. Verify WiFi credentials in configuration
2. Check that the WiFi network is accessible
3. Ensure the WiFi password is correct
4. Try connecting to a different WiFi network for testing

### If WebSocket Connection Still Fails:
1. Verify the WebSocket URL is correct (`ws://10.50.92.58:8000/ws`)
2. Check that the webserver is running and accessible from the device
3. Verify firewall settings on the server

### If Device Still Shows "Host is unreachable":
1. Check network connectivity between ESP32 and webserver
2. Verify the webserver is listening on the correct IP and port
3. Test WebSocket connection from another device to confirm server accessibility
