# HotPin Firmware Fix Summary

## Problem Analysis
The ESP32 firmware was experiencing a Guru Meditation Error (LoadProhibited exception) during WiFi initialization specifically in the `esp_phy_load_cal_and_init` function. The backtrace showed the crash happened during logging operations when trying to execute `strlen` on a NULL or invalid pointer.

## Root Causes Identified
1. **Memory pressure**: WiFi initialization requires significant memory and was competing with chunk pool allocation
2. **Configuration mismatch**: Use of CONFIG_ constants that might not be properly defined in the build system
3. **Timing issues**: Initialization sequence that could cause race conditions
4. **Missing memory checks**: No verification of available heap before critical operations

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Fixed WiFi Initialization Sequence
- Moved WiFi initialization before chunk pool allocation to prevent memory pressure
- Added memory availability checks before WiFi initialization
- Added proper error handling and cleanup on failure
- Used `strlcpy` instead of direct assignments to prevent buffer overflows
- Initialized `wifi_config` to zero to avoid garbage values

### 2. Updated Configuration Constants
- Fixed the configuration header to properly define CONFIG_ constants
- Ensured backward compatibility with existing code references

### 3. Improved Error Handling
- Added proper error checking for all WiFi initialization steps
- Implemented proper cleanup procedures on initialization failure
- Added memory availability verification before critical operations

### 4. Optimized Timing
- Added appropriate delays between initialization steps
- Changed initialization sequence to WiFi first, then chunk pool
- Added memory checks before and after WiFi initialization

## Files Modified
- `main.c`: Updated initialization sequence and added memory checks
- `network_handling.c`: Fixed WiFi configuration and error handling
- `config.h`: Fixed configuration constant definitions

## Expected Results
The firmware should now:
- Successfully complete WiFi initialization without crashing
- Handle low-memory conditions gracefully
- Provide more detailed logging about memory usage
- Continue operation even if WiFi fails (graceful degradation)
- Have improved stability during startup phase

## Additional Notes
The fix addresses the primary crash issue during WiFi initialization. If further issues are encountered, they may require:
- Adjusting task stack sizes
- Fine-tuning memory allocation for the audio chunk pool
- Reviewing the I2S driver initialization (though that's required for audio features)
